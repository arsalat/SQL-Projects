In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. 
Conclusion

Some facts we can conclude from this data are:

Bangladesh is the most densely populated.
Uganda has the highest population growth, and hence the highest birth rate.
Germany has the highest death rate.
Japan, South Korea and Thailand have the least migration rate.
Spain has the highest migration rate.
